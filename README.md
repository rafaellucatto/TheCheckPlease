This was the first iOS app I ever made when I was starting to learn Swift from scratch (beginning with Storyboard for example).
This is a very simple app, but it is protocol-oriented and made with MVVM with coordinator.
Within this code, you can also find some samples of unit tests and some tests of snapshot.
Basically it helps you calculate how much you and/or a subset of your friends should pay for something before ordering it.
